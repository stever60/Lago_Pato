Metadata for Site information for Lago Pato in Torres del Paine National Park

Abstract
The dataset comprises of  GPS site data, bathymetric data  from Lago Pato, a small lake basin at S51°18.020’, W72°40.716’ and ~ 33 m a.s.l., water chemistry collected from lakes in the region made in 2007 and precipitation data  generated from the ERA-INTERIM model for Lago Pato. The data are used to help constrain glacier dynamics and lake level change in the TdP and Última Esperanza region over the last ~30,000 cal a BP (30 ka). 

Funding source
This project was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) through the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and an UGent BOF bilateral collaboration project. RMcC was supported by Programa Regional R17A10002 and R20F0002 (PATSER) ANID. We gratefully acknowledge the University of Magallanes (UMAG) and the University of Santiago (Carolina Diaz) for assistance with fieldwork; the NERC/SUERC AMS Radiocarbon Facility for providing initial range-finder radiocarbon dates; the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory (NIGL, now National Environmental Isotope Facility, NEIF, at the British Geological Survey) and Melanie Lang for stable carbon isotope analysis; Aberystwyth University (David Kelly), Durham University (Neil Tunstall and Christopher Longley) and Edinburgh University (Chris Hayward) for use of their core scanning and microprobe facilities and technical support.

Methodology
GPS data were collected using Trimble differential GPS, accurate to 0.1 m with values quoted as ±2-sigma (95% error). Other elevations were determined from ‘Google Earth’, and are on average, 6.7±5.9 m (2-sigma) higher than the geoid-corrected dGPS field measurements, hence, we assigned ±10 m errors.

Lake water chemistry (pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen) were measured in and around Lago Pato and several nearby lakes with a YSI600 Sonde. Light penetration was measured with a Secchi disc and water samples were taken at one metre intervals in the water column of Lago Pato. Data from lakes in Patagonia was collected from a near shore sampling point. 

Modelled annual and seasonal precipitation for 1979–2016 at Lago Pato was generated from the ERA-INTERIM dataset generated using the BAS internal portal http://basweb.nerc-bas.ac.uk/icd/toil/clivarm_data/index.html.
