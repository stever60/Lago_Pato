METHODS

Sediment cores were collected using a UWITEC-gravity corer, Livingston piston corer from the deepest point (~3.5 m of water depth) in Lago Pato (LP08: S51° 18’01.2’’, W72° 40’43.0’’, 32 m a.s.l., 600 cm total recovered sediment depth).

Biology
Subsamples for diatom and stomatocyst analysis were taken at 4 cm and 8 cm intervals from the LP08 core. At least 400 valves were counted per slide and species were identified to at least genus level using taxonomic studies from the region. Microscopic pollen, charcoal and cryptotephra shards were counted at 8 cm intervals in the LP08 core) with Lycopodium spores of known concentration added for quantification. The total pollen sum from each subsample is at least 300 land pollen grains (Total Land Pollen, TLP) above 470 cm in the LP08. Charcoal was classified in five different size classes, <25 µm, 25–50 µm, 50–75 µm, 75–100 µm, and >100 µm, to distinguish between proximal and distal fires.

Chronology
A chronology was established using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating. Calibration of radiocarbon ages was undertaken in OXCAL v.4.4 using the SHCal20.14C Southern Hemisphere atmosphere calibration curve (SH20). Radiocarbon ages are reported as conventional radiocarbon years BP (14C years BP) ±1σ and calibrated ages as 2σ (95.4%) ranges, median and mean calendar years BP (cal a BP and cal ka BP, relative to 1950 CE), rounded to the nearest ten years. Age-depth models were developed using Bayesian age-depth modelling software (rBACON v.2.5). Modelled age data mean ages produced by the SH20M1H (Southern Hemisphere, SHcal20, radiocarbon calibration curve) in rBACON, where M1 indicates Model 1 and H indicates the inclusion of a hiatus in the model.

Geochemistry
Sediment cores were collected using a UWITEC-gravity corer, Livingston piston corer and a Russian corer from the deepest point (~3.5 m of water depth) in Lago Pato:
-	LP08 record from  S51° 18’01.2’’, W72° 40’43.0’’, 32 m a.s.l. is 600 cm long
-	LP16 record from S51°18’11.3’’, W72° 40’53.7’’, 33–34 m a.s.l. is 295 cm long

Contiguous downcore wet-sediment Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) X-ray fluorescence core scanning (XRF-CS) data was collected using an ITRAX XRF core scanner at Aberystwyth University fitted with a Molybdenum (Mo) anode X-ray tube (settings: 30 kV, 50 mA, count time 10 seconds, at 2 mm contiguous intervals and for LP08 Unit 6 (equivalent to mean ± 2-sigma: 4.5±7.0 years), at 200 μm intervals for LP08 Unit 1 (1.3±4.2 years),  with LP08 basal Unit 1 scanned at 100 μm, and at 500 μm for LP16 Units 2-6 (9.6±17.4 years) and at 200 μm for LP16 Unit 1 200 μm (1.1±1.6 years). Data from finely laminated glaciolacustrine sediments in Units 1-2 were measured at or smoothed to 200 μm (from 100 μm interval data) before analysis.

Sedimentology
Physical properties were measured with a Geotek® multi-sensor core logger (MSCL) (gamma-ray wet density (ɣ-density), resistivity and magnetic susceptibility (MSκ; SI x 10-5) data (Bartington Instruments; LP08: MS2C loop sensor, 2 mm intervals, 10 seconds; LP16: MS2E point sensor, 0.5 mm intervals; 10 seconds) and density-corrected MSχ (κ/ρ; kg m-3)). Digital X-radiographs were obtained from split cores using a rotating anode mobile digital Celtic SMR CR computerised X radiography unit at Cambridge University Vet School (48kV; 4 mAs; no grid) and as ITRAX generated digital X-radiographs (45 kV, 50 mA.ms, 200 ms, 60 µm interval) at Aberystwyth University. Subsample data includes Loss-on-ignition (LOI) (12 hrs drying at 110°C, 4 hrs at 550°C (LOI550), and 2 hrs at 950°C for carbonate-proxy (LOI950x1.36), TOC (Total Organic Carbon (%C or %Corg) and total nitrogen (%N) and carbon isotopic ratios (δ13C). 

Time series analysis 
Log-n element/Ti ratio XRF-CS Z-scores were used for time series analysis (Fast Fourier Transform, FFT, periodograms, Lomb-Scargle Power Spectrum, Wavelet Power Spectrum, Peak Identification) in MATLAB. Equally spaced (10-year and 100-year) time-intervals were generated using a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolated Polynomial (PCHIP) function, which avoids spline artefacts and preserve the shape of the original XRF-CS data series (Grinsted et al., 2004; Trauth, 2015). Time series data were detrended (polynomial linear best fit) to remove the long-term linear trend. Second order polynomial Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) 100-year smoothing (0.1 sampling interval with outliers removed) was also used to compare datasets to published data.

Data were analysed in MATLAB v. R2021a, R v. 4.1.0/Rstudio v. 1.4.171,  using the R packages Vegan, Rioja, Tidyverse, ggplot2, Ggally v. 2.1.2, and in Sigmaplot v. 14.0 and C2 v.1.7.7. Code is available from: https://github.com/stever60/Lago_Pato

DATA QUALITY

Chronology
Radiocarbon ages were rounded to the nearest 10 calendar years (cal a BP) in file LP08- C14_data.csv and the results section and to the nearest 100 years (0.1 cal ka BP) in the discussion to reflect dating and age-depth modelling uncertainties.

Geochemistry
ITRAX-XRF Raw count per second (cps) data were analysed using the Q-spec software v8.6.0 (Cox Analytical), with MSE values minimised to optimise the fit of ‘as measured’ spectra to a modelled spectrum. data  are presented as percentages of the Total Scatter Normalised ratio sum (%∑TSN or, more simply, %TSN, which are equivalent to percentages of the cps sum, or %cps) to account for downcore variations in count rate, density, water and organic content. Data less than mean minus two-sigma kcps (mainly due to gaps in the core) and greater than MSE plus two-sigma (representing a poor fit between measured to modelled spectra) were filtered before analysis. ‘Noisy’ elements were eliminated by comparing cps and using %TSN thresholds of >0.1% mean and >0.5% maximum, and by examining autocorrelation profiles for each element (Bishop, 2021). For LP08, this left 12 ‘measurable’ elements for the LP08 record (Si, S ,K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr, and inc., coh. scatter). Elements are presented as natural log (log n or Ln) ratios. Ti-normalised log n ratios are used to estimate changes in relation to the background bedrock input. Duplicates runs were undertaken on ~10% of the total core depth (LP08-1F at 2 mm and 200 microns). For LP16, this left 17 ‘measurable’ elements for the LP16 record (Si , S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr , Ba, and inc., coh. scatter). Elements are presented as natural log (log n or Ln) ratios. Ti-normalised log n ratios are used to estimate changes in relation to the background bedrock input. Duplicates runs were undertaken on ~10% of the total core depth (LP16-3B at 200 and 500 microns). 

Sedimentology
Carbon isotope δ13C data, values were calculated to the VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standard calibrated against NBS-19 and NBS-22. Replicate analyses of sample material gave a precision of ± 0.1 (per mil) for δ13Corg and 10% for C/N. Flux data (g cm a-2) were calculated from the product of dry mass accumulation rates (g cm a-1), dry bulk density (g cm-3), sedimentation rates (cm a-1) and proxy concentration measurements.

DATA RESOLUTION
Geochemical XRF-Core scanning data were measured at 2 mm contiguous intervals and for LP08 Unit 6 (equivalent to mean ± 2-sigma: 4.5±7.0 years), at 200 μm intervals for LP08 Unit 1 (1.3±4.2 years), with LP08 basal Unit 1 scanned at 100 μm. Data from finely laminated glaciolacustrine sediments in Units 1-2 were measured at or smoothed to 200 μm (from 100 μm interval data) before analysis.Geochemical XRF-Core scanning data were measured at 500 μm for LP16 Units 2-6 (9.6±17.4 years) and at 200 μm for LP16 Unit 1 200 μm (1.1±1.6 years). XRF-CS data from finely laminated glaciolacustrine sediments in Units 1-2 were smoothed to 200 μm, other data to 2mm, and equal spaced time-intervals (10-years and 100-years) for use in time series analysis were generated. Time series datasets were centred, standardised (Z-scores), detrended and interpolated using a 10-year or 100-year Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) function, which avoids spline artefacts and preserve the shape of the original XRF-CS data series.
